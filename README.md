# What's Boggy?
This is Boggy, a simple but powerful 2D game engine written in C++ using the SFML framework. Boggy was initially created as a lightweight game engine for Ludum Dare 32, however, I have intentions to carry on expanding the engine and hopefully ship some titles with it.

# What makes Boggy so special?
Well, if you're into getting your hands dirty on low-level code then Boggy is for you. There is no internal WYSIWYG editor, so all levels must be hard-coded for now. There are plans to integrate support for the Tiled Map Editor, so watch out for that.

I will write more of a documentation as the engine expands. As it stands right now, Boggy is not fully stable and there is no official website - Boggy is simply in the conceptual stage.

Thank you for your interest in my project.
